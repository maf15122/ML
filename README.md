Project Title: Application of Machine Learning in Recommender Systems
Contributors: Mahdi and Anchala  

In this project we will answer the following questions:
1-	By considering IMDb movie dataset, what are the 5 most similar movies to a movie search?
2-	By using KNN algorithm, how does considering different distance metrics (e.g. Euclidian, Mahalanobis, and Manhattan) affect the results? 


This project includes the following folders:
1)Literature; it includes all of the articles that are used for this project
2)Data; it contains various dataset from IMDb 
3)Code; this project will be written in python and will be saved in this folder
